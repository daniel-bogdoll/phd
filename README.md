### Reviewer 1

##### Overall recommendation	
-1: (weak reject)
  
##### Summary
The submission deals with a meta-collection of data-sets for autonomous driving, i.e., a collection of pointers to data-sets collected by others. In addition to the mere pointers, technical information on the 3rd party data-sets is provided, e.g., duration, size, sensors, etc.

##### Detailed comments
The submission deals with a meta-collection of data-sets for autonomous driving, i.e., a collection of pointers to data-sets collected by others. In addition to the mere pointers, technical information on the 3rd party data-sets is provided, e.g., duration, size, sensors, etc. This meta-collection has a lot of value to the community as it provides a fast and easy access to the many data-sets for autonomous driving that exist. But I am missing some clear academic insights that would motivate the publication of a paper on it at AAMAS. The submission is a mere description of the tool, which in addition is focused on basic technical parameters of the data-sets. What is lacking are academic aspects related to important research questions in autonomous driving. For example, how "flat" is the data-set, i.e., how much change in the z-coordinate, respectively roll and pitch is in there? How big is the "overlap" between consecutive sensor readings, i.e., the relation between sensor range, update rates, and vehicle speed? As mentioned, I consider the main idea and the contribution to the community as very relevant. It is definitely useful to have a white paper on it that can be cited, e.g., using arXiv. But I am not convinced that the submission is a good match for AAMAS.

##### Rebuttal question	

##### Reason for the recommendation
This collection of links to 3rd party data-sets generated by others is useful for the autonomous driving community, but it is not well suited as an AAMAS paper.

### Reviewer 2
  
##### Overall recommendation	
-2: (reject)

##### Summary
This paper describes the creation of a website to allow users to browse through all relevant autonomous driving datasets.

##### Detailed comments
It is difficult to assess this paper because the central offering of this paper is a website which we the reviewers do not have access to.

The website idea is indeed useful and can be kept up to date by the authors. However, due to the pace of AV research, this paper will likely be out of date within a year of being published. In my opinion, having the website as the sole contribution of this work is not enough to warrant publication. The paper could be improved by adding a detailed review of existing dataset papers and proposing future directions / needs in this area.

One important question in the field is to what extent datasets and benchmarks can be used as an indicator for progress in autonomous driving research. What is missing from current datasets? What could be done better? Is it better to rely on datasets or simulation environments? Machine learning algorithms assume that samples are IID (independent and identically distributed) and that the training distribution matches the test distribution, does this make sense in autonomous driving?

How can we decide which datasets are relevant to self-driving and which are not? There are datasets out there that were originally designed for unmanned ground vehicles, but could certainly be used to develop algorithms that would benefit autonomous vehicles. Should these be included? What about the older computer vision datasets that still have some relevance?

The authors should review the abstract and introduction and make the following improvements:
- Keep the abstract short and to the point, motivation can be condensed to 1 sentence here.
- In the introduction, the authors can condense their justification for the importance of autonomous vehicles to 1-2 sentences.
- I'm not sure I agree with the motivation. Do researchers need a tool to find datasets beyond simply using search engines themselves? Recent dataset papers like Waymo include tables that compare what they offer against other datasets, is this not sufficient? Moreover, there exist more general research tools like www.connectedpapers.com which allow users to find new papers based on a given paper as a query.

For the related work section, instead of summarizing other papers and websites that have tables or summaries of autonomous driving datasets, this paper's related work should summarize all the datasets out there itself. The summary could follow historical trends in datasets and/or be divided by task.

I'm not sure that the headings "approach" and "evaluation" are appropriate for those sections. Perhaps divide this into "selection process", "metrics", and "comparison".

"size" should not be it's own section, this information can be contained in a table.

I would like to see the number of tables and figures greatly expanded to include more statistics that help give the readers a better picture of what datasets are out there and how they compare.

##### Rebuttal question	

##### Reason for the recommendation
In my opinion, having the website as the sole contribution of this work is not enough to warrant publication. The paper could be improved by adding a detailed review of existing dataset papers and proposing future directions / needs in this area.

  
### Reviewer 3
  
#####  Overall recommendation	
-3: (strong reject)

##### Summary
The paper presents a tool that collects a number of datasets for self-driving cars that were identified through manual search over research papers and social media. Such a tool has been enriched with search and filtering capabilities.

##### Detailed comments
The paper discusses a potentially useful tool for performing research in the self-driving car space.

However, there are a number of major issues that makes the publication not suitable for AAMAS:
- the paper does not present any novelty, as the implementation is standard.
- it is not clear how the paper plans to keep the dataset up-to-date in a sustainable way: currently, the datasets have been added manually and the paper expects the community to contribute. Note that the paper should discuss clearly why previous datasets are not usable anymore.
- the number of properties are quite straightforward and, while important, they do not provide any insight on what datasets to use for testing.

The tool might be more useful if there is an actual automated analysis of the datasets that will provide insights on their diversity for example.

==== After rebuttal
Thanks for providing a response and recognizing the limitations -- please consider the comments to enhance the contributions. Thanks also for providing the link.

##### Rebuttal question	

##### Reason for the recommendation
As discussed in the detailed comments, while potentially a useful tool, what proposed in the paper does not display novelty, actual sustainable effort, nor actionable information.
  
### Meta Review
The paper describes the creation of a web site containing a list of data sets collected by others. This is helpful, but the list alone does not comprise enough content for this to be an acceptable paper. It is also unclear how the resource described provides a contribution to the community beyond existing web-based resources. As it stands, the analysis and value of the resource is limited. The domain is autonomous driving. The content is not sufficient for an academic paper and has limited value to the AAMAS community.

### Reviewer 1

##### What is your overall impression? How does the paper align with machine learning towards autonomous driving?
The paper addresses the important problem of compressing sensor data from autonomous vehicles. They leverage pre-existing neural compression models involving VAEs and GANs. They further present a comprehensive study of the performance of these models for image data for downstream tasks such as detection.

The writing is clear and the experiments are convincing. The authors also analyse examples for various driving datasets. As such, the paper aligns really well with the topic of the workshop and will be of broad interest to the community.

##### Are the task, theory or method new? Is it clear how this work differs from previous work?
Yes

##### Does this address a difficult task in a better way than previous work?
Yes
  
##### Is the writing clear?
Yes
  
##### Are claims well supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results?
Yes
  
##### Are the authors honest about evaluating both the strengths and the weaknesses of the work?
Yes
  
##### Are others likely to use the ideas or build on them?
Yes
  
##### What could the authors do to improve clarity, theory, or experiment?
Figure 2 could be better presented with a finer x-axis. It will be useful to see where the inflection points occur for JPEG and the neural methods. Additionally, the experiments should be conducted for a larger section of the dataset and failure modes identified.

##### Your overall assessment?
Accept
  
### Reviewer 2

##### What is your overall impression? How does the paper align with machine learning towards autonomous driving?
  
The authors apply established VAE- and GAN-based models to compress image and lidar data in an automotive context. These approaches are compared with each other and with JPEG compression, considering different evaluation scores and visualizations. The paper is easy to understand and the presentation of (most of) the results is clear (for details see below).

They argue for the relevance in the field of autonomous driving (AD) as self-driving systems will not be perfect in the near future, thus rendering human assistance necessary in complicated traffic situations. Considering remote operators, large amounts of sensor data need to be transmitted. While this motivation for compression is overall plausible, one might further detail how such remote-assistance scenarios look like and which requirements they pose (see below).

##### Are the task, theory or method new? Is it clear how this work differs from previous work?
No
  
##### Does this address a difficult task in a better way than previous work?
No
  
##### Is the writing clear?
Yes
  
##### Are claims well supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results?
Yes
  
##### Are the authors honest about evaluating both the strengths and the weaknesses of the work?
Yes
  
##### Are others likely to use the ideas or build on them?
Yes
  
##### What could the authors do to improve clarity, theory, or experiment?
conceptual aspects:
- you could describe the circumstances/scenarios of "remote assistance" in more detail (will a remote operator actually take over during a critical situation? will the vehicle conduct an emergency stop and the remote operator will only take over once a safe state is reached? consider not only fps rates for practical feasibility, but also the latency introduced by sending a signal to the remote operator and back
- you could add safety-specific aspects to your evaluation, e.g. by paying special attention to critical image areas (e.g. driveable areas) and / or the detection of vulnerable road users

technical aspects:
- introduce abbreviations "SAE" and "VA"
- on p.4, l.141, make more clear that GANs will not be used for processing lidar data in subsection 4.2
- on p.5, l.180 it is stated that "JPEG is worse than the generative approaches", however, for not too small bit rates it yields competitive results (see Figure 2)
- better explain how Figure 4 is constructed (was a smoothing routine (e.g. KDE) applied to the relative-error histogram on the x-axis? are the values of the pdfs color-coded by shades of blue/orange? are there no relative-error values above 200%? relative-error distributions are not that easy to interpret: for n_orig = 1, n_recon = 0 leads to a relative error of -1, for n_orig=10, one missed object leads to only -0.1, i.e. the relative-error distribution encodes the objects-per-image distribution)
- on p.6, l.223: "more objects" instead of "more images"
- the sentence "the VAE approach was trained and tested on KITTI lidar data" (p.7, l.236) could be interpreted that separate models are used for image and lidar data compression, in the caption of Figure 1 it is however stated that "the pre-processed lidar data passes through the same encoder as RGB data"
- provide details on the CARLA data sample (seemingly) used in subsection 4.3. How do the KITTI-based plots in Figure 2 look like for this data set?

##### Your overall assessment?
Weak Accept
  
### Reviewer 3

  ##### What is your overall impression? How does the paper align with machine learning towards autonomous driving?
I do not think that there are significant contributions in this paper and the direction isn't clear. The paper applied existing, learning-based, compression methods onto autonomous driving RGB images and point cloud data, all of which are results that can be obtained from the original description of the work.
While the authors mention a potential application in remote assistance of autonomous vehicles, this idea wasn't clearly emphasized.

##### Are the task, theory or method new? Is it clear how this work differs from previous work?
No

##### Does this address a difficult task in a better way than previous work?
No

##### Is the writing clear?
Yes

##### Are claims well supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results?
Yes

##### Are the authors honest about evaluating both the strengths and the weaknesses of the work?
Yes

##### Are others likely to use the ideas or build on them?
No

##### What could the authors do to improve clarity, theory, or experiment?
Using learning-based methods for low-latency compression for teleoperated vehicles is an interesting topic. However, the ideas presented here are not novel and doesn't really add to the exploration of this topic. I recommend that the authors review other publications in this area, potentially focusing on some of the specific points (non-exhaustive) below:
1) Latency reduction (and comparison with classical/established video compression method)
2) Since the goal is for remote operation/assistance, there should also be some mention on acceptable latency
3) Bitrate reduction/robustness to packet losses/adaptive bitrates (again perhaps in comparison to established compression methods)

##### Your overall assessment?
Reject

### Reviewer 1

##### Comments to authors* Please assess the contribution of this submission (if any). Please provide comments to the authors to help them improve their work, or to explain your recommendation.
The authors want to show the challenges and goals of machine interpretable definitions of corner cases for automated driving by presenting six research questions.

Main feedback
- The contribution beyond state-of-the-art is not clear. Roughly 2.75 pages of 5 (excluding references) are filled with introduction and related work. Additionally, the remaining pages read like state-of-the-art since any valuable information is either a reference to other papers or unproven. The paper only contains general ideas without any indication on how to address the problems that need to be solved (e.g. how to keep the corner case description so flexible to represent any corner case, but rigid enough to be useful for machine interpretation, how to generate the descriptions, etc.).
- The authors cite reference 7,8 and especially 16 a lot, these papers are from one research group. Reference 8 and 16 are only available on arXiv, so they are not published and not peer-reviewed. Reference 16 is cited 14 times within the paper. The left image in figure 2 is the exact same as in reference 16 except for the car color, but it is not cited.
- Abstract contains little more information about the content of the paper than the title, i.e. information on the process and the results

Other notes:
- Paper ID is missing
- Chapter 1: Contribution is not mentioned / unclear. It is claimed that corner case description can improve the performance of ML models, but this remains unproven
- Line 50-51: Should be elaborated more.
- Line 117-120: Missing reference
- The relevance of listing different frameworks for defining street scenarios (chapter 2.1.1-2.1.4) in not apparent
- Line 264: Why quotes?
- Line 285: "CCD can ... act as a trigger during fleet recordings" should be elaborated a bit more to convey the usefulness. Is this intended as live interpretation of the current driving scenario and saving either an annotation or the corner case description?
- Chapter 3 & 4: Would be the contribution of the paper, but contain many unproven assumptions, like "we can automatically describe CC and generate them", "With CCD as an extension, this becomes possible, improving upon existing approaches drastically", etc. This is worded like it already working, but it is never presented/proven.
- Figure 2: As written above. The left image in figure 2 is the exact same as in reference 16 except for the car color, but it is not cited neither exists any indication that the generation of the image was part of the current work.
- Line 426: "To improve this situation, first, a CCD is necessary." The wording should be more humble. This is a very theoretical paper without showing any working solution.

##### Comments to authors* Please assess the contribution of this submission (if any). Please provide comments to the authors to help them improve their work, or to explain your recommendation.
Positive: The paper is well written and structured. It gives a good overview over the research area of corner cases and existing state of the art. The core message is formulated research questions for further work.

Negative: I would like to see a larger and more application focussed section 4 with empirical examples of failure due to CC, or graphs/media to visually underline the text. The high occurence of abbreviations makes the text difficult to read.

### Reviewer 3
##### Comments to authors* Please assess the contribution of this submission (if any). Please provide comments to the authors to help them improve their work, or to explain your recommendation.
This paper propose an approach for corner case detection guided by best-practice. The general idea is very relevant and is certainly worthy of further exploration. However, the authors essentially describes a research outline to the problem and provides very abstract solutions only. The potential of corner case descriptions (CCD) for three challenging situations becomes apparent to the reader, but the solutions still seem to be very vague.
