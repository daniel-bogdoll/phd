abstract = {The major goal of research regarding mobile service robotics is to enable a robot to assist human beings in their everyday life. This implies that the robot will have to deal with everyday life environments. One of the most important steps towards able service robots is to enhance the ability to operate well in unstructured living environments. In this paper we focus on the integration of object recognition, obstacle detection and collision free manipulation to increase the service robots manipulation abilities in the context of highly unstructured environments.},

Instead of limiting treatment to just artificial, structured lab areas, such systems must in particular be able to operate well in human, unstructured environments. In this paper we present an approach to recognize and localize as well as reliably and robustly manipulate objects in the presence of obstacles. Our method was implemented, fully integrated and presented on the 2009 CeBIT technology show in Hanover, Germany using the experimental robot of the DESIRE project.},
