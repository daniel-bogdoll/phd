\begin{enumerate}
    \item General concept (EG JMZ 06/2021):
    \item Description as complete as possible
    \item Detection for sub-classes, e.g. scene
    \item Handling for one very specific case (StvO) --> here one could say "I know if it's a perception or a handling problem and thus I do consider only one". This idea from JMZ has the issue that error propagation is still possible (how do you know where the error is?). Therefor I will stick with the assumption of perfect perception in the handling part, even though he doesn't like it. (one of his ideas: detector detects traffic light as green, but the vehicles crossing the road are driving, therefore the traffic light should be red for the vehicle or something else is going on --> how does wrong perception affect planning?) 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Rise of data: KITTI (2012, http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/)
    \item Rise of ML: AlexNet (2011/2012 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet)
    \item Rise of autonomous driving: DARPA (2004,2005, 2007)
\end{enumerate}

Lots of prototyping, now (2021) the issue of scaling autonomous vehicles in the real world is coming. Corner cases get more and more important, since the vehicles are very mature in well defined Operational Design Domains (ODDs).

\section{Scope and Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Natural, external corner cases, no attacks or hardware-defects
\item Urban Scenarios (no highspeed)
\item Focus on simulation (CARLA) due the issues that ccs are often impossible or dangerous to perform in real life
\item Multi-modal sensor setup from a typical AD stack (camera, lidar, radar)
\item Encapsulated methods, no error propagation (perfect eprception in planning chapter)
\item Research on functions, no validation/verification
\item No active learning (EG 06/2021)

Debate about why finding cc and re-training on them is non-sense (my idea: generalize for any kind of cc). JMZ: After learning a corner case, it's not a corner case anymore (from the method-view).


\end{itemize}
