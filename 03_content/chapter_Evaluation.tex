\section{Some evaluation stuff}

Notes of EG with JMZ 06/2021

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Systematic of the evaluation:
    \item What do I evaluate? Want to show that Perception/Handling works.
    \item Sim2Real (nvidia and Intel Papers for perception)
    \item JMZ want at least demonstration on CoCar (1 Component, variations of 1 scenario). I think either perception (in KIGLIS?) or something which affects the planner (driving area based on KI-W?)
    \item Generator that generates scenarios in CARLA. Then argue the selection (e.g. samples for scenarios in categories). Alright if it's not complete (see EG 07/2021 skizze ppt, scenario based evaluation)

\end{enumerate}
