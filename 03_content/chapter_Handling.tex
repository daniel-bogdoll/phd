\chapter{Handling of Corner Cases}
\label{chap:handling}

Notes from EG with Marius from 06/2021:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Utilize ontology during inference or during training?
    \item Full focus on KI-W, no remote assistance
    \item JMZ would also like "novel scenarios" from Breitenstein
    \item Idea: E2E can try to do things which would be prohibited by another E2E/classical system (stretching the rules)
    \item Detect CC
    \item Use ontology to evaluate multi-modal trajectory outputs of E2E network
\end{enumerate}
