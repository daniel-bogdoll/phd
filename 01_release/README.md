## Releases

PDF releases to reviewers are collected here. Also the different final versions will be found here.


### File namings

It's good practice to add a `CONFIDENTIAL_*` to PDFs that are not publically released yet, e.g.
* `CONFIDENTIAL_kuhnt_dissertation_v0.5.pdf`
* `CONFIDENTIAL_kuhnt_dissertation_v1.0_cam_ready.pdf`

and only remove the `CONFIDENTIAL_*` tag at PDFs that can be released publically:
* `kuhnt_dissertation_copyright.pdf`
